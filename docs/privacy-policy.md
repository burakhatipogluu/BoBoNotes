# Privacy Policy — BoBoNotes

**Last updated:** February 26, 2026

## Overview

BoBoNotes is a text editor for macOS. Your privacy is important to us — BoBoNotes is designed to work entirely offline on your device.

## Data Collection

BoBoNotes does **not** collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data. Specifically:

- **No analytics or tracking** — We do not use any analytics SDKs, trackers, or telemetry.
- **No network access** — BoBoNotes does not connect to the internet. All features work entirely offline.
- **No accounts or login** — There is no user account, registration, or authentication.
- **No cloud storage** — All files are stored locally on your Mac. BoBoNotes never uploads your content anywhere.
- **No cookies** — BoBoNotes does not use cookies or similar technologies.

## File Access

BoBoNotes only accesses files that you explicitly open or select. File access is managed through macOS security-scoped bookmarks, which means:

- The app can only read and write files you choose through the standard macOS file dialog.
- Workspace folders are accessed only after your explicit selection and permission.
